        <p>
          Hi, I'm Josephine, a fullstack developer with a passion for frontend technologies. 
          I specialize in building dynamic and interactive web applications using React, Vite, and TypeScript.
          With a strong background in both frontend and backend development, I enjoy creating seamless and user-friendly experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have experience working with a range of technologies and tools, and I'm always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges. 
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, experimenting with new recipes, or diving into the latest tech trends.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
